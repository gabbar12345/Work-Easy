As a response to the pandemic, businesses worldwide have recognized the need for, and the ability to, support employees working remotely – from home.  Many companies have announced policies allowing employees to permanently work remotely. This reality has given rise to a new way of working: hybrid work models 

 

The Hybrid Work Model takes into reality the desire and ability of employees to work remotely, usually from home, and the business/ team need for them to occasionally – but on some regular cadence – come to the workplace for face-to-face interactions. It is a working arrangement that allows teams to collaborate with each other both remotely and in person. The aim of hybrid work is to provide teams – as well as the organization they work for – with the benefits of both onsite and remote working models.
